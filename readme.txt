Hello There!!!

Now We Have:
	1. Neural Network with single layer as a dummy project.
	2. Neural Network with Multiple Layers as another dummy project.
	3. Network is currently tested on XOR Problem.

TO DO:

* Add new activation functions as used in tensor flow. eg ADAM
* Use this project as a working library in other projects. eg Image classifier(MNIST)
* Use in HealthCare rojects
	-> Diabetic Retinopathy
	-> Oncology (Cancer Detection)
* Or for projects like
	-> Flood Forecasting

*Study 
	-> ML-KIT 
	-> Auto-ML
	-> Cloud TPU's
	-> TensorFlow
	-> Nature Medicine Paper published By Google
	
	-> Kotlin


*GOALS
	-> Speech Recognition
	-> Computer Vision
	-> Text To Speech
	-> Language Linguistics
	-> Recurrent Neural Network
	-> Bi-Directional Encoder Representations for Transformers
